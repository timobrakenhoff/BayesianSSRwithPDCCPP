Scripts accompanying the manuscript: "Bayesian sample size re-estimation using power priors" 

This repository contains the R code used to obtained all presented results in the following manuscript:
Title:   "Bayesian sample size re-estimation using power priors"
Authors: T.B. Brakenhoff, K.C.B. Roes and S. Nikolakopoulos

Corresponding author: T.Brakenhoff (t.brakenhoff@gmail.com)

The "TOP_level_20180215.R" file is the top level file in which the simulation and the example analysis are both run. 
All other necessary scripts are sourced in the TOP level script and used for the final results.

The "Gamma_PDCCPP_procedure.R" file is a script specifically detailing a small but essential part of the simulations where the
gamma PDCCPP parameter is calculated based on the observed data.

For details regarding the methodology and its implementation please see the manuscript.
